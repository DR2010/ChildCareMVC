        Belonging, being and becoming are integral parts of identity.
        Children learn about themselves and construct their own identity within the context of their families and communities. 
        This includes their relationships with people, places and things and the actions and responses of others. Identity is not fi xed. It is shaped by experiences. When children have positive experiences they develop an understanding of themselves as
        significant and respected, and feel a sense of belonging. 

        Relationships are the foundations for the construction of identity – ‘who I am’, ‘how I belong’ and
        ‘what is my influence?’ In early childhood settings children develop a sense of belonging when they feel accepted, develop attachments and trust those that care for them. As children are developing their sense of identity, they explore different aspects of it (physical, social, emotional, spiritual, cognitive), through their play and their relationships.

        When children feel safe, secure and supported they grow in confidence to explore and learn. The concept of being reminds educators to focus on children in the here and now, and of the importance of children’s right to be a child and experience the joy of childhood. Being involves children developing an awareness of their social
        and cultural heritage, of gender and their significance in their world. Becoming includes children building and shaping their identity through their evolving experiences and relationships which include change and transitions. Children are always learning about the impact of their personal beliefs and values. Children’s agency, as well as guidance, care and teaching by families and educators shape children’s experiences of becoming.
